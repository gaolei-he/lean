# ProofWidgets

ProofWidgets is a library of user interface components for [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/). It
supports:
- symbolic visualizations of mathematical objects and data structures
- data visualization
- interfaces for tactics and tactic modes
- alternative and domain-specific goal state displays
- user interfaces for entering expressions and editing proofs

### How does ProofWidgets relate to user widgets?

ProofWidgets relies on the [user widgets](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/examples/widgets.lean.html)
mechanism built into Lean. User widgets provide the minimum of functionality needed to enable
custom user interfaces. ProofWidgets builds on top of this with a higher-level component library,
syntax sugar, and user-friendly abstractions. Stable parts of ProofWidgets may eventually be
backported into user widgets, but ProofWidgets overall is intended to be kept separate from Lean
core.

## Usage

### Viewing the demos

The easiest way to get started is to clone a **release tag** of ProofWidgets and run
`lake build :release`, as follows:

```bash
# You should replace v0.0.3 with the latest version published under Releases
git clone https://github.com/EdAyers/ProofWidgets4 --branch v0.0.3
cd ProofWidgets4/
lake build :release
```

After doing this you will hopefully be able to view the demos in `ProofWidgets/Demos/`. Top tip: use
the pushpin icon (![pin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/31b33da05aab662f1973ba5667dad672c8e20fbc/src/icons/pin.svg))
to keep a widget in view. You can then live code your widgets.

### Using ProofWidgets as a dependency

Put this in your `lakefile.lean`, making sure to reference a **release tag**
rather than the `main` branch:
```lean
-- You should replace v0.0.3 with the latest version published under Releases
require proofwidgets from git "https://github.com/EdAyers/ProofWidgets4"@"v0.0.3"
```

Note that [developing ProofWidgets](#developing-proofwidgets) involves building TypeScript code with NPM.
When depending on `ProofWidgets` but not writing any custom TypeScript yourself,
you likely want to spare yourself or your users from having to run NPM.
ProofWidgets is configured to use Lake's [cloud releases](https://github.com/leanprover/lake/#cloud-releases) feature
which will automatically fetch pre-built JavaScript files *as long as* you require a release tag
rather than the `main` branch.
In this mode, you don't need to have NPM installed.

### Developing ProofWidgets

Contributions are welcome! Check out issues tagged with "good first issue".

The package consists of widget user interface modules written in TypeScript (under `widget/`),
and Lean modules (under `ProofWidgets/`).
To build ProofWidgets from source, you must have NPM (the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) package manager) installed.
During a build, we first compile the TypeScript widget code using NPM,
and afterwards build all Lean modules.
Lean modules may use TypeScript compilation outputs.
The Lakefile handles all of this, so executing `lake build` should suffice to build the entire package.
In order to build only the TypeScript, run `lake build widgetJsAll`.
Widgets can also be built in development mode using `lake build widgetJsAllDev`.
This makes them easier to inspect in developer tools.
Outputs of `npm` commands are not always shown by default: use `lake build -v [target]` to see them.

üí° The NPM part of the build process may sometimes fail with missing packages.
If this happens, run `npm clean-install` in the `widget/` directory and then try `lake build` again.

‚ö†Ô∏è We use the `include_str` term elaborator to splice the JavaScript produced by `tsc` into our Lean
files. The JS is stored in `build/js/`. Note however that due to Lake issue [#86](https://github.com/leanprover/lake/issues/86),
rebuilding the `.js` will *not* rebuild the Lean file that includes it. To ensure freshness you may
have to resort to hacks such as removing `build/lib/` (this contains the `.olean`s) or adding a
random comment in the Lean file that uses `include_str` in order to ensure it gets rebuilt.
Alternatively, you can run `lake clean` to delete the entire build directory.

## Features

### JSX-like syntax

```lean
import ProofWidgets.Component.HtmlDisplay
open scoped ProofWidgets.Jsx

-- click on the line below to see it in your infoview!
#html <b>You can use HTML in lean! {toString <| 1 + 2>}</b>
```

See the `Jsx.lean` and `ExprPresentation.lean` demos.

### Support for libraries

We have good support for building diagrams with [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/), and expose
some [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) components for plotting functions and other kinds of
data. See the `Venn.lean` and `Plot.lean` demos.

For more purpose-specific integrations of libraries see the `Rubiks.lean` and `RbTree.lean` demos.

### Custom `Expr` displays

Just like delaborators and unexpanders allow you to customize how expressions are displayed as text,
ProofWidgets allows "delaborating" into (potentially interactive) HTML. See the
`ExprPresentation.lean` demo.

### Multi-stage interactions

Proof widgets can be used to create proving loops involving user interactions and running tactics
in the background. See the `LazyComputation.lean` demo, and the `Conv.lean` demo for an example of
editing the proof script.

### Animated HTML

As a hidden feature, you can also make animated widgets using the `AnimatedHtml` component. This
works particularly well with libraries that ease between different plots, for example Recharts.
You can see an example of how to do this in the `Plot.lean` demo.
